# 📘 Manual Testing Repository  
_Professional Manual QA Portfolio_

This repository contains my complete Manual QA portfolio, structured with realistic documentation and aligned with the testing workflow used in corporate environments.

Work collaboratively with multinational teams.

The project represented here was developed during my work at CI&T, a company headquartered in Campinas, Brazil, yet globally recognized and operating across multiple countries.
In this context, I supported an international LATAM client, serving as the sole QA Tester on the team and directly responsible for ensuring product quality.

I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team composed of:
- 5 Developers
- 1 Tech Lead
- 1 Business Analyst (BA)
- 1 Scrum Master (SM)
- 1 SQA (responsible for quality audits)
- 2 Product Owners (POs)
- A dedicated UX/UI Design team responsible for building desktop and mobile prototypes, components and user flows using Figma
- Additionally:
I validated requirements, user journeys, component behavior, layout consistency and UI constraints directly in Figma — for both desktop and mobile versions — before creating test plans, scenarios and cases.

This experience strengthened my ability to:

 - Analyze requirements with precision
 - efine complete and effective test strategies
 - Execute tests across multiple environments (DEV, STAGE)
 - Produce clear, objective, and auditable documentation

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository demonstrates my full manual QA skillset, including:

- Requirement analysis (User Stories)
- Test strategy definition
- Writing detailed and structured Test Cases
- Executing tests in different environments
- Reporting defects clearly and objectively
- Performing Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

## 🧪 Testing Workflow

My documentation follows the real testing flow used in my company:

### **1️⃣ Dry Test — DEV Environment**
Low-level validation performed during early development.  
Purpose:
- Validate initial implementation  
- Check basic functional behaviors  
- Identify breaking issues early (pre-QA checks)

Artifacts produced:
- Initial notes (if needed)
- Early bug reports

---

### **2️⃣ System Test — STAGE Environment**
Full functional validation of the feature.  
Purpose:
- Verify end-to-end functionality
- Validate acceptance criteria
- Execute all test cases
- Ensure system stability before release

Artifacts produced:
- Test Plan
- Test Cases
- Test Execution Report
- Bug Reports
- RCA (if major issues happen)

## 📷 Importance of Test Evidence

Test evidence is a critical part of the QA process. It ensures transparency, traceability, and reliability of the work performed. Well-documented evidence allows teams to:

* **Validate test results objectively**
  Screenshots, logs, and videos prove exactly what happened during execution.

* **Support defect reporting**
  Clear evidence accelerates debugging and prevents misunderstandings between QA, Dev, and Product.

* **Ensure accountability and auditability**
  Evidence creates a documented history of each test performed, essential for compliance and quality audits.

* **Improve collaboration**
  Developers and analysts can easily reproduce scenarios using visual and written references.

* **Strengthen delivery confidence**
  Stakeholders trust results when they can see what was executed and how it behaved.

This repository includes consistent evidence for each executed test (when applicable), following best practices of professional QA teams.

## 🧩 Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Located in `/rca/en-us/`, these documents use professional RCA methods such as:

- 5 Whys  
- Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)  
- Corrective & Preventive Actions (CAPA)  
- Impact and Severity Analysis  

RCA proves my ability to identify systemic problems and propose improvements.
