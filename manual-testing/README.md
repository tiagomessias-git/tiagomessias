## 🧪 Testing Workflow

My documentation follows the real testing flow used in my company:

### **1️⃣ Dry Test — DEV Environment**
Low-level validation performed during early development.  
Purpose:
- Validate initial implementation  
- Check basic functional behaviors  
- Identify breaking issues early (pre-QA checks)

Artifacts produced:
- Initial notes (if needed)
- Early bug reports

---

### **2️⃣ System Test — STAGE Environment**
Full functional validation of the feature.  
Purpose:
- Verify end-to-end functionality
- Validate acceptance criteria
- Execute all test cases
- Ensure system stability before release

Artifacts produced:
- Test Plan
- Test Cases
- Test Execution Report
- Bug Reports
- RCA (if major issues happen)

## 🧩 Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Located in `/rca/en-us/`, these documents use professional RCA methods such as:

- 5 Whys  
- Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)  
- Corrective & Preventive Actions (CAPA)  
- Impact and Severity Analysis  

RCA proves my ability to identify systemic problems and propose improvements.
